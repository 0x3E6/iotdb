    Used in UDTF#beforeStart(UDFParameters, UDTFConfigurations).

    When the access strategy of a UDTF is set to an instance of this class, the method UDTF#transform(Row) of the UDTF
    will be called to transform the original data. You need to override the method in your own UDTF class.

    Each call of the method UDTF#transform(Row) processes only one row (aligned by time) of the original data and can
    generate any number of data points.
