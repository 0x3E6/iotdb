    User-defined Time-series Generating Function (UDTF)

    New UDTF classes need to inherit from this UDTF class.

    Generates a variable number of output data points for a single input row or a single input window (time-based or
    size-based).

    A complete UDTF needs to override at least the following methods:
    * beforeStart(UDFParameters, UDTFConfigurations)
    * transform(RowWindow, PointCollector) or transform(Row, PointCollector)

    In the life cycle of a UDTF instance, the calling sequence of each method is as follows:
    1. validate(UDFParameterValidator)
    2. beforeStart(UDFParameters, UDTFConfigurations)
    3. transform(RowWindow, PointCollector) or transform(Row, PointCollector)
    4. terminate(PointCollector) 5. beforeDestroy()

    The query engine will instantiate an independent UDTF instance for each udf query column, and different UDTF
    instances will not affect each other.

        This method is mainly used to customize UDTF. In this method, the user can do the following things:
        * Use UDFParameters to get the time series paths and parse key-value pair attributes entered by the user.
        * Set the strategy to access the original data and set the output data type in UDTFConfigurations.
        * Create resources, such as establishing external connections, opening files, etc.

        This method is called after the UDTF is instantiated and before the beginning of the transformation process.
